## Comments

- User & ATM bills are stored in local storage (I assume no one would have access to it for an ATM) - for web services I would use sessions or tokens.

- I left console logs for ATM bill balance and user state for testing purposes.

- Interface is designed for an ATM with touchscreen and external keypad

- Even though the app is responsive to a degree, I havenâ€™t optimised for different types of smartphones yet
